        description: "This thesis report has introduced the UWB Indoor Localization System. In the beginning, this thesis report has explained the Indoor Localization System and presented existing techniques (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) to construct an Indoor Localization System. Then, this thesis report has discussed the Ultra Wideband Radio fundamentals to analyze its construction and operating mechanism. During the transmission, the UWB signals will pass an additive white Gaussian noise channel with multipath effects, which cause errors in the values of bits. This thesis report has studied different solutions (such as Modulation Methods and Rake Receiver) to improve the bit error rate in different situations (such as Multipath-free AWGN channel). Next, this thesis report utilizes the UWB Radio fundamentals to show and compare different positioning algorithms (such as TOA and AOA). This thesis report focuses on TOA algorithm. For TOA algorithm, this thesis report has analyzed the IEEE UWB standards and the UWB Radio fundamentals to present and compare different types of receivers. Finally, this thesis report has studied algorithms (such as WLS) to solve non-linear equations to find the position of a mobile station with NLOS effects. In this thesis report, an algorithm (removing excess delay) has been used to mitigate NLOS effects with the simulation based on IEEE 802.15.4a channels. The simulation results are shown in chapter 12, and the average positioning error is around 7 cm."
